# Design Handoff

Week 9. This project involved buliding a landing page with React components and incorporating a given design from UX design students @Technigo. The design was given to us through a hand-off through demo and Figma file.
The brief was to build with React, preferably Styled Components, use reusaable components and finish it of as close as possible to the design.


## The problem
Such a rewarding and fun week!  I created a sketch on what components i needed and how they could be used regarding weather my designer wanted it to be shown on different screen sizes and if it could be reusable. I also acknowledged the bigger challenges and started with the basic structure first.

I used npm packages for my carousels and struggled a bit with overriding it's built in styling-properties at first. Indeed challenging but revarding to learn!

The project was handed to us on tuesday and due to Easter holidays there where som limitations on time for this week. I ended up with leaving the hamburger menu slightly unfinished and should evolve the accessibilty if I had more time.
