# Design Handoff

For this project I had to bring to life a design by a UX designer student at Technigo's bootcamp. The main focus was to use react styled components. The site was a landing page for an acrobatics gym.

## The problem

The challenge was mainly regarding positioning the sections of the page according to the Figma design. 
To make the page responsive all measuremtns needed to be calculated and converted to relative units. 

I also tried the react-resposive-carousel package to implement an image carousel on the page. 

I drew help from documentation, stackOverflow and other team mates.
