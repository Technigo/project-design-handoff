# Design Handoff

Build a landing page following design given by UX student, using React and reusable components.

## The problem

I started with looking at the design and devided it into different sections (components), I then created two global styled components (one for text and one for buttons) that I could reuse in every section. I did one section at a time and always did mobile first.

If I had more time I would implement styled components instead of vanilla CSS.
