# Design Handoff

Welcome to my web project which is made with a collaboration with a UX Designer, Cecilia Lestrell, who designed the entire layout & system.

As the designer says, the idea was to create a website and an app which encourages to 
activate both you and your dog through a range of workouts. 

From the front-end development point of view, this project is made using React components & Vanilla CSS.
## The problem

I started developing the web by trying to use styled components, however, as at the time of this project they were relatively new to me, I decided to proceed with the Vanilla Css instead, to save time (I had only four days to accomplish this project). 

I used the React library and downloaded Fa Icons to use for the purposes of the hamburger menu ( note - the menu does not work, is NOT activated, as that was not the purpose of the project ).

For me, the biggest challenge in  CSS styling is fixing the background picture so it looks fine for all screen sizes. I spent a lot of time to try the best properties for the background in the navbar, so the hero image fits all mobile devices well. I experimented with the percentage of the background size and background position. 

It's a great experience to elaborate on a project with a designer, especially as I could see the other side of web creation and find the best way of communciation.
