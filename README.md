# Design Handoff

This project has been done in a collaboration between me and another UX-student at Technigo who supplied the specs. Focus has been from my part to follow the specs and make us of React and styled components.

## The problem

The handoff was done 2 days before easter and we were given very little time to complete the task. I sat most through the holiday trying to get as far as I could. That which is still missing is responsiveness to  media screens above 1200px width.
