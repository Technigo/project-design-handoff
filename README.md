# Design Handoff

This React App is designed to showcase how to implement and integrate various design elements such as color, typography, and hierarchy in web design using Styled Components as a CSS framework.

Design by UX Designer: Sima Boreiri

## The problem

I attempted to implement a UX designer's given design in React. It was the first time using reusable components and styled-components, resulting in insufficient time to complete the entire design. Due to color contrast issues with the background image and limited space on small mobile devices, I had to deviate from the original design. However, with the assistance of my code mentor and ChatGPT, I managed to complete certain aspects of the design.
