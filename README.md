# Design Handoff

We worked in groups of six, five dev's and one UX-designer. The designer provided the design in a Figma-file. We had a hand-over where we could ask questions about the design and discuss it before starting the development. In our group we chose to split up the workload into parts, so every developer contributed with at least one component. 

## Brief

This week you will experience a design hand-off from a UX-design student and work on transforming that design into code. It is a landing page for a gym/fitness club and you will build it in React. We want you to think about how you structure the site and what components to create, and preferably use styled components as the styling. Your mission is to follow the designs thoroughly, but keep in mind that the designs are made from students that are, like you, learning a new profession. Interpret the design kindly.

This is a perfect opportunity to explore fun npm packages to create an image carousel or make some fun animations if that’s included in the design.

**What you need to do**

✓ The app should be built with React (and preferably Styled Components)

✓ Your app should have reusable components

✓ Your app should look as close as possible to the given design
