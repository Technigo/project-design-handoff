# Design Handoff

This project was completed as part of the React Sprint in the Technigo bootcamp. The goal was to build a landing page using React and learn about components and styling.

The landing page was designed by UX students and provided as a design hand-off. Through this project, I learned about the role of color, typography, and hierarchy in web design. I also learned how to use Styled Components as a CSS framework to style React components.

Overall, this project helped me to strengthen my React skills and better understand how to work with designers and create visually appealing web pages.
