# Design Handoff

This is my first design handoff from a UX-student. It's made to spec as far as
I could with the time restraints for the project.

## The problem

For this projct, I took the opportunity to get more familiar with styled components. This is why they are used for EVERYTHING. I can confidently say many of the of the styled components are totally overkill for this project and would have been better solved with css files.

For the carousel I've used Swiper. I could not get it to work as I wanted and does not look as the design. The popup is coded by me.
 
Towards the end I got tired, so there are mixes of px and rem in there. If I had more time I would go over the code and use consistent units.
