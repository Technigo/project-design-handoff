# Design Handoff

A collaboration with Technigo's UX/UI Design bootcamp students. Our assigment was to turn a landing page for a fitness club (in my group's case, a power yoga studio) made in Figma into code, using React.

## The problem

This week's new topic was styled components. I wanted to really get into the logic of them and understand why and when they can be useful. I styled the entire landing page with styled components only, and can say that I really enjoyed the process (though a bit complex at first) and will definitely keep using styled components.
