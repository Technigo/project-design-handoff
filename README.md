# Design Handoff

This week's task was to work on a design made by a UX student @technigo. The app should be built in React and if we wanted, we could try out Styled Components. The app should have reusable components and look as closely as possible to the given design. 

## The problem

Given the fact that we had less time than usual to finish this project (Easter holidays), I tried to focus on one section at the time and make that section responsive before moving on to the next one. I had to accept that I'd probably not have time to finish all 8 sections and that that would be fine. If I had more time I would do the two missing sections from the design spec and work more on the more specifics like margins etc.
