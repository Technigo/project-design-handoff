# Design Handoff

In this project we got to work with a student from Technigo's UX-designer program and got the assignment to attempt to follow and code their design for a landing page. 

## The problem

I got to work with UX-design student Karin Lindmark. I started working on this landing page by trying to sketch and mentalize what kind of code structure I needed to make the design happen. It was an extremely well-planned design with a lot of elements to code. Unfortunately the working week was small in scope and I had not the possibility to work on it as much as the design needed. The design included some coding challenges that I had not worked with before, such as an image carousel. Sadly, I did not succeed with making it work, I will have to ask for help to try to fix it in the future. 

It was very nice to work with a UX-designer and get the experience of collaborating, I wish I had been able to make her design more justice, but I am happy with the knowledge I gained. If I had more time I would make the page responsive (I have only worked with the mobile view) and I would like to make the image carousel work and add some design elements that are missing.
