# Design Handoff

This assignment was about having a design hand-off from a UX designer student and then follow the design while working together how it would be done in practice.
Furthermore, the main topic for the duration of this project was to learn and use styled component.

## The problem

I've started with the initial planning, what could be a resuable compknent and what not. I've started with the mobile first approach and compared the design for each media screen how to best create components.
I've used npm package to add a carousel.
The page is responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop.
