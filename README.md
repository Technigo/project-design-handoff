# Design Handoff

Follow the design created in Figma by a UX design student.
It should be created with React and it was suggested to use styled components.

## The problem

In the design there was a few features that was new to me. Changing from hero image to hero video in the header.
Have an image slider. Have the text change on buttons and pictures in the cards depending on screen width.
I tried as much as possible to implement useEffect and useState for some scenarios.
I started out with the approach to make one section/component to work fine on all screen sizes.

I ran out time before the deadline to hand in, so when I have more time I will:
*Arrange the slider for desktop, to not have it show or show all 4cards at a time.
*Create all the details for hoover effect and similar things that are in the design, but I did not manage to arrange in time.
*Arrange for another format for the video, as it does not show in Safari.

If I was to start over, I would take more time to plan and study the design in Figma more in detail. I was to eager to get going. I feel because of that I ended up with code that I could have structured in another way. For example to add the different font styles in typography to begin with instead of adding them as I went along.

I definitely feel like a learned a lot about styled components, so that I will use it better in next project and also try to have more reusable components.
