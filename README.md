# Design Handoff

This was a build done by Sima Boreiri who designed a webpage in mobile tablet and desktop. I built it as best as I could using React and a variety of different styled components. 

## The problem

I started with the mobile first and then tried to make it responsive in desktop and tablet. I tried several new npm packages including react-icons, react-multi-carousel, and a new hamburger menu. I was unable to get the npm package for the hamburger menu to work so I rebuilt without.
