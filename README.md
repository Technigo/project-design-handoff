✓ How to use Styled Components as a CSS framework

## The problem
A designer handoff with larger scale CSS is intimidating for me and will be something I will need to practice in near future without time pressure. Most of the design is thanks to a classmates help. I tried practicing styled components and did manage some things like a Button component and the usage of it in the code, but the scale of this project and the amount of time to hand it in before holidays, work and other obligations became my main hinder. I will need to redo something similar in future time.
