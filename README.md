# Design Handoff

I received a design from a UX student which I had to build using React. I had to follow the design as closely as possible and make it responsive for tablet and desktop.

## The problem

I started by deciding what would be in each component and sketching out what elements woud be used where. I then began with styling the mobile first, starting from the top to the bottom. It was challenging to have different layers and backgrounds on top of others, that moved responsively in different sizes. My Classes and Final Section components still need to be polished. If I have more time I would like to add a carousel feature.
