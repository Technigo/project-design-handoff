# Design Handoff

In this assignment at the Teachnigo Bootcamp we collaborated with the UX class and made one of their designs come to life by using React and some styled components and npm packages.

## The problem

I approached this task by watching Cecilia, the UX designer, walk us though the design in Figma. After that I talked to de developers in my group on how to structure the code roughly and after that I made a sketch in Figma what of what components to create. I started off by creating component-folders, js-files, css-files. Every section of the page became a component and inside some components I used styled-components.

Me and Ajmal from my team talked and worked a lot together during this assignment to be able to complete this rather advanced design (for our level at this point). Im proud of what we accomplished in just 4 days.
