          I used to envy my dog, who always would finds joy in the little things and be
          very present with what is. He truly is my meditation master!”

        <p>“I used to have a very troubled relationship with food...
          I would constantly crave something sweet and I have NEVER enjoyed cooking.
          I tried out this program because it combines nutrition with   mindfulness.
          The meal plan is catered/personalized to your own lifestyle and habits,
          and I was surprised how easy (and tasty) the recipes are. I feel so much
          more energized, focused and I no longer eat sweets all the time!”

        <p>Being able to be mindful of my body movements for 20 minutes
          was something I never thought I&apos;d be able to do. Now my favorite Saturday activity
          is doing yoga in my garden - even early in the morning!
